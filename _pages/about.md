**Xilong Cheng** is a third-year Master‚Äôs student at the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Communication University of China, advised by [**Yunxiao Qin**](https://qyxqyx.github.io/homepage/). He has a strong interest in streaming media narratives, cognitive psychology, and behavioral psychology. His research focuses on leveraging AI technologies to build more generalizable role-playing systems, aiming to construct highly realistic social simulation environments.

His current research interests center on anthropomorphic generative agents, character personas, and social simulation, including but not limited to:
1.	**Role-playing agents**: Exploring the role-playing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the goal of developing generalizable role-playing systems. This includes: (1) accurate and quantitative evaluation of LLM role-playing abilities; (2) constructing high-quality character datasets based on existing narrative materials; (3) advancing role-playing capabilities from text-based to multimodal foundation models; and (4) building realistic social simulation environments based on generalized role-playing systems.
2.	**Psychology in language models**: Enhancing the anthropomorphic capacity of LLMs from a psychological perspective (e.g., self-awareness, personality, memory). The goal is to enable LLMs not only to perform well when modeling well-known characters but also to generalize to modeling and representing ordinary individual roles.
3.	**More realistic social simulation systems**: Investigating social simulation systems grounded in role-playing agents, with an emphasis on equipping models with both ‚ÄúSystem 1‚Äù (intuitive decision-making) and ‚ÄúSystem 2‚Äù (deliberative planning) capabilities, thereby enabling more authentic simulation of social behaviors and dynamic interactions.

In parallel, he is also working on **human-inspired self-supervised learning for long-form first-person videos**, aiming to develop richer video representations that capture temporal dynamics and embodied perspectives.

### Interests
Beyond my academic focus on Large Language Models and Role-Playing Language Agents, I also have a strong passion for sports, particularly football and, more recently, tennis. While I see sports as an essential form of relaxation, I equally enjoy streaming media and reading literature on modern psychology, which help me unwind and broaden my perspective.
